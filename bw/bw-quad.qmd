Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x=math, y=verbal, color=State)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ fracCat)
  theme_minimal()
```
