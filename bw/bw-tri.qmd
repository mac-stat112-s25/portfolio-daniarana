title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x=length, y=time, color=rating )) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```
